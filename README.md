# Spotify-Data
Analysis of Amiri's personal Spotify data in Python
This repository is a project to help me shake off the Python rust after using R exclusively the past two semesters. It's my friend Amiri's personal Spotify data I'll do an exploratory data analysis on.
The first thing I did was change the timestamps to datetime and seperate the listening time to morning (0:00-12:00), afternoon (12:01-7:00), and night (7:01-12:00). I created a barchart comparing the timeshare of listening among those groupings from 2019-2023, which I've decided is the timeframe to study his listening habits.
