This repository is a project to help me shake off the Python rust after using R exclusively the past two semesters. It's my friend Amiri's personal Spotify data I'll do exploratory data analysis on.
Attached is the [code](https://github.com/lukebeebe/Spotify-Data/blob/main/Amiri%20Analysis.py) and in the [png folder](https://github.com/lukebeebe/Spotify-Data/tree/main/png) is its outputs.
