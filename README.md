- This repository is a project to help me shake off the Python rust after using R exclusively the past two semesters. It's my friend Amiri's personal Spotify data I started doing exploratory data analysis on.  
- Attached is the [code](https://github.com/lukebeebe/Spotify-Data/blob/main/Amiri%20Analysis.py) and in the [png folder](https://github.com/lukebeebe/Spotify-Data/tree/main/png) is its outputs.  
- After some analysis, I figured it'd be better if I could make something for him to do analysis with. So I started making a [Mad Libs prompt](https://github.com/lukebeebe/Spotify-Data/blob/main/Song%20and%20Location.py) that takes his inputs of year, month, day to eventually find a specific time where it looks up his location via his IP Address attached to the data.  
- Now, I'm looking to make a [game](https://github.com/lukebeebe/Spotify-Data/blob/main/Guessing%20Game.py) from the data, where it gives him a location and date and he has to name an artist he was listening to. This is a work in progress.
